# PPSC_Comp_1: Treasure Necklace
**| difficulty: 4/10 |**

You uncover a hidden treasure box at the beach while building a massive sand castle. Inside, you find a shiny necklace, a scroll, and a pair of scissors. The necklace seems to be made up of two kinds of beads. Unrolled, the scroll states that the necklace holds an invaluable treasure, containing history that could change the world. But, the secret can only be released if the necklace is cut at the correct point, and the largest group of beads are removed. Otherwise, a poisonous gas will be released and fatally contaminate the beach.

Example:

Necklace: **kkgggkkkkkggggggkkkkkkkgggkkgkgggggkkkgg** 
return "**7**" (length the largest group of beads "kkkkkkk" in the necklace)
